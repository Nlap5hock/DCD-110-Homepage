      <p class="myclass">Maisa Imamović's "The Psychology of The Web Developer" begins its first three chapters with some very interesting narritives. Firstly, Maisa decribes her own experience using the chatbot, Spleak to help practice her english.<br>
     Although, after having used it as a way to practice learning a new language, she describes how she began to develop a "friendship" with Spleak. Maisa later goes on to describe Spleak as a "role model" to her as well. This reminded me <br>
     of how in DCD 100 last semester, we leared about how people can bond with AI chatbots and see them as true friends rather than just machines.

  <p class="myclass">In chapter 3 of Maisa Imamović's "The Psychology of The Web Developer", she discusses the idea of Presentation websites, which she
     describes as digital containers that display a subject in a marketable and structured way. The rely heavily on templates, grids, 
     categorization, and a clear hiarchy of information. Maisa also discusses real-time websites. These websites create immersion through interaction
     by allowing users to "write" as well as read the site in a controlled system. In chapter 4 she goes in-depth into the topic of the "simple" website. </p>
