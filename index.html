  <h1>My Reflection</h1>
  
      <p>Maisa Imamović's "The Psychology of The Web Developer" begins its first three chapters with some very interesting narritives. Firstly, Maisa decribes her own experience using the chatbot, Spleak to help practice her english.<br>
     Although, after having used it as a way to practice learning a new language, she describes how she began to develop a "friendship" with Spleak. This reminded me of how in DCD 100 last semester, we leared about how people can bond with 
     AI chatbots and see them as true friends rather than just machines. Chapters two and three introduce us to Larry and Scoot, respectively. Scott is the owner and developer of a new CBM company and Larry is his assistant.
